# InnerSource Project Template

## What is this repository/project?

This project offers a **template** that can be used by anyone willing to create a new project based on resources that are commonly used in **Open Source** projects.

It is a template, but at the same time contains the information of the project itself, so it is an example of its application itself.

Despite of the title, **it should work either for InnerSource or Open Source projects**. Of course it is far from being perfect nor complete, it is just one possible approach. So, it is open to modifications either on your side or by proposing changes to this template via Pull Request. Something that is useful for you, can also be useful for others.

*This file is the usual entry point for newcomers, so make sure you keep it small, understandable and straight-forward. Point to other more detailed resources as needed.*

## Get in touch

*This section explains how to get in touch with the project team. In order to keep it simple, don't describe all possible interactions (There's a [Governance model](/doc/governance.md) for that), just the first most basic ones...''*
